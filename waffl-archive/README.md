## Purpose
WAFFL Archive is the digital home of the Westwood Affiliated Fantasy Football League, a dynasty league founded by my friends in 2013. My Friend and commissioner, Kyle Harris, has poured much of himself into maintaining an exhaustive list of statistics througout the league's history in a series of Google Sheets. It was my hope to allow him to continue to maintain his records there, while also using that data to produce an interactive frontend experience to browse that data. As a result this repository contains the frontend Gatsby application that consumes the node API I use to extract the data from the Google Sheets containing league data.
