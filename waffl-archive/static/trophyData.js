Sitting at just 2-4 over the 2018’s first 6 games, it looked like another unlucky lost season for the Cartels. They responded by firing off 8 wins over the next 10, including a playoff run for the ages where she lost starters Keenan Allen and Aaron Jones to injury before they could even score a point in the first round against WAFFL’s all-time highest scoring regular season roster, the Digital Rays.

After quickly trading away aging star Adrian Peterson for a package of running backs, the fortunes quickly turned around as he won 7 of the next 8 games. Hobbling to the finish line and only winning one game in the last four weeks, the Islanders brought their A-game in Round 1 and Jamaal Charles had one of the greatest fantasy performances of all time, scoring 58.5 points. Despite losing in the championship game, this team has a bright future ahead with an excellent core of players like, DeMarco Murray, LeVeon Bell, Jamaal Charles, and Calvin Johnson. You can expect perennial playoff appearances from the Islanders. The team finished the 2013 regular season with 1914.1 points, second in the league.'

After absolutely falling on his face out of the gate in 2013 (starting with a 1-5 record), the Beer has gone 15-7 in the regular season since. A trade for LeVeon Bell in the offseason gave this team a brand. They dominated with three elite running backs all year long in Bell, Marshawn Lynch, and Arian Foster. After starting 2-2, the Beer won 8 of their last 10 regular season games and dominated more and more as the season went on. The Beer should be able to follow up well on their stellar campaign but they will still need all the help they can get with the elite three running backs.

Shawn Webster adopted this team in the offseason following the 2014 season and was the clear favorite to finish in last place. A trade for Devonta Freeman and aquisition of rookie David Johnson were key to this team of super-sleepers rising into playoff contention. The odds of a playoff berth were stacked against the Nadoes even late in the season. The Chili Peppers dropped their last three and the Toad Lickers dropped their last four to allow a Nado playoff berth. In Week 14, 4 teams ahead of him lost their games to push the Nadoes up into the 4th seed, where he upset the first seed Beer in Round 1. The Cinderella story ended when losing to Not The Jets in the WAFFL Bowl, but the Nadoes have to be happy about their performance in 2015, especially since they don't own their own draft pick.

This team blew it up after a couple of playoff appearances in ‘13 and 14’, going a respectable 13-15 over the next two while “tanking”. Over those two tanking years, this team’s only significant acquisition was stud RB Ezekiel Elliott with 2016’s 1.01. In the offseason of 2017, they got hot. Draft picks of Evan Engram and Juju Smith-Schuster alongside trade acquisitions of Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram completely skyrocketed this team to superstardom. After going 12-2 and getting into the championship, this team fell victim to the Todd Gurley buzzsaw while still scoring the 2nd most points in the league in Week 16.

Yes, that’s Week 16, the championship game where Not The Jets were forced to go with literal NFL backup RB Alfred Blue in their 3rd championship appearance all-time. They suffered their first ever playoff loss (5-1 all-time) and decided to blow up the team that just went to back-to-back championships. Time will tell if this rebuild will be nearly as fast as the first one. Not The Jets scored 1789.24 points in the 2018 regular season, 4th best in the league.'

				'One of the most interesting stories of the 2013 season. The Cartels started off at a red-hot 4-1 before losing superstars Aaron Rodgers and Randall Cobb for the remainder of the fantasy season. Losses began to build up quickly and the team soon sat at 5-5. In what looked like a lost season, she put together the right stop-gap pieces to make a playoff push and met the Chili Peppers in the regular season finale, where they both were 7-6, one win away from playoffs. This crippled team earned the 4th seed in a 126.6-114 victory. History may see regular starters Ray Rice, Darren Sproles, Anquan Boldin and Greg Jennings that look like this team had plenty of help, but these players were well past their primes and put up poor 2013 campaigns, making the playoff berth particularly impressive. The Cartels lost to the eventual champion but pulled off an upset in Round 2 to finish in third place despite the adversity. The Cartels scored 1599.5 points in 2013, only 7th in the league.'

This core of players was exceptionally impressive with both the number one RB and WR, DeMarco Murray and Antonio Brown. He also had the number two WR and number seven RB in Jordy Nelson and Jamaal Charles. The Chili Peppers dominated all season long but drew the short stick in an impressively stacked playoff matchup in Round 1 between them and Beer. With a strong 2014 campaign combined with the league's oldest starting lineup, the Chili Peppers reign at the top projects to be shorter than others and he will hope to put a similar campaign together next season.

The Ice Babies led the league in total points for the 3rd straight year in 2015, but had a serious mid-season slump, averaging 100.7 PPG through Weeks 9-12.

After deciding to obliterate a roster that got them to the 2013 championship game in hopes of finding gold in the now-historic 2014 draft class, the Islanders have to be happy with their slightly-early 3rd year payoff. The Islanders came into the season with a top-heavy team that featured Mike Evans and Odell Beckham and found the perfect complimentary young pieces that set the team up for a 6-game win streak to end the season. The Islanders go into the offseason with zero top-30 draft picks for the next two years, and have to hope that their established core is enough to lead them to success.

The hyper-consistent roster returned every single starter from their championship season, but saw steep drop-offs from Jordy Nelson (32) and Demarco Murray (29) and didn’t make a single waiver transaction all season.

The Digital Rays scored more points in a regular season than any other team in the league’s history (2280.6) and set the record for the most points scored in a game (221.5 points in Week 10). They couldn’t pull off the elusive undefeated regular season but became just the 2nd team in history to win 13 games in a season next to the Ice Babies in 2014. This Digital Rays team had two top-5 RBs, three top-10 WRs and the 2nd best TE alongside league-best depth, but fell flat when the pressure came on as they lost in round one to the Cartels with early injuries to two key starters (even though the Digital Rays averaged 23.45 more PPG in the regular season). The Digital Rays remain one of the strongest favorites WAFFL has seen, but a 25-3 regular season record paired with a 1-2 playoff record over the last two years has been an all-time disappointment.
